## 📜 Overview
This repository contains a curated and structured dataset designed for Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning. The dataset focuses on providing [insert domain — e.g., conversational AI, coding assistance, business advice, etc.]-specific data to improve model performance, accuracy, and domain understanding.


The dataset has been carefully prepared to ensure:

High-quality and diverse examples.

Well-structured formatting for training frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI fine-tuning.

Ethical and safe content.

## 📄 Data Format
The dataset is in JSONL (JSON Lines) format, compatible with most LLM fine-tuning frameworks.

Example (Instruction-Tuning Format):

```json
Copy
Edit
{"instruction": "Translate 'Hello, world!' into Spanish.", "input": "", "output": "Hola, mundo!"}
{"instruction": "Summarize the text: 'Artificial Intelligence is changing the world...'", "input": "", "output": "AI is transforming industries and society."}
```
Example (Chat Format):

```json
Copy
Edit
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris"}]}
```

## 🛠 How to Use
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
Copy
Edit
pip install datasets transformers
```
2️⃣ Load Dataset with Hugging Face
```python
Copy
Edit
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("path/to/dataset")
print(dataset["train"][0])
```

### 3️⃣ Fine-Tune with Hugging Face Transformers
```bash
Copy
Edit
python run_clm.py \
  --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
  --train_file data/train.jsonl \
  --validation_file data/validation.jsonl \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \
  --per_device_eval_batch_size 2 \
  --output_dir ./fine-tuned-llm
```

## 📏 Quality & Cleaning Process
